# JWT Security Misconfiguration — Authentication Bypass

## Overview
This project examines a web application vulnerability caused by weak JWT signing secrets and improper token validation. The issue allowed token tampering and privilege escalation by brute-forcing the signing key.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- JSON Web Token (JWT) structure and validation
- Authentication and authorization weaknesses
- Secure key management
- Web security testing methodologies

## Tools & Techniques
- jwt_tool
- Burp Suite
- Token decoding and re-signing (lab-based)

## Outcome
The misconfiguration was exploited in a controlled environment, resulting in unauthorized privilege escalation. Remediation guidance focuses on strong key management and token lifecycle controls.
