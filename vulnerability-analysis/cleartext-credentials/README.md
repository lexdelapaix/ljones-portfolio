# Cleartext Credential Transmission — Network Traffic Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a security failure where authentication credentials were transmitted in cleartext over HTTP. Network traffic inspection revealed sensitive data exposure due to missing transport-layer protections.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis
- Cleartext credential exposure (CWE-319)
- Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Secure authentication practices

## Tools & Techniques
- Wireshark
- Packet capture analysis
- HTTP request inspection (lab-based)

## Outcome
Credentials were identified through packet inspection in a controlled environment. Mitigation strategies emphasize enforcing TLS and securing authentication endpoints.
