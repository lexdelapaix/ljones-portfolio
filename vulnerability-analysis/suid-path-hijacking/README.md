# SUID Path Hijacking — Privilege Escalation

## Overview
This project analyzes a privilege escalation vulnerability caused by improper handling of system paths in a SUID-root binary. The application executed system commands without specifying absolute paths, allowing an attacker to hijack execution through PATH manipulation.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Linux privilege escalation
- SUID binary analysis
- Improper privilege management (CWE-269)
- Secure coding practices and remediation

## Tools & Techniques
- Linux command-line utilities
- SUID enumeration
- Source code review
- Environment variable manipulation (lab-based)

## Outcome
The vulnerability was successfully identified and exploited in a controlled lab environment. Mitigation strategies were documented to prevent real-world exploitation.
